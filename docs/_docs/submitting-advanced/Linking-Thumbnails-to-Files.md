title: Linking Thumbnails to Files

This page describes how to provide thumbnails for imaging files so that viewers may preview the file without having to download a large file to their own system and opening it. There are two cases:

1. You have uploaded the source files but have _not_ yet uploaded their corresponding thumbnail images.
2. You have uploaded both the source files _and_ their corresponding thumbnail images.

**Important: In order to link to the source file, you must know the filename of the source file.**

## If you have not already uploaded the images, but you have uploaded the files

Do the following for each file:

* Make sure you are signed in as a FaceBase Writer (you have joined the FaceBase Writer group for your project).
* Search for your file (drilling down using the filter sidebar or adding keywords to the search bar).
* Click the View (“eye”) icon (in the _Action_ column) to view its metadata. (Warning: Do not click the Edit "pencil" icon - this is only editing the base record - not related records.)
* Scroll down to the "Thumbnails" section and click the _Add_ link (to the far right of the section).
* In the Image field, use the _Select File_ button to upload your thumbnail file.
* Fill out the _Caption_ field to describe the image it corresponds to.
* In the "Thumbnail of" field.
* Click the dropdown field and search for the corresponding source filename, then click the corresponding select box.
* Scroll down to the "Show in dataset" field and choose _true_.
* When you are finished, scroll back to the top of the page and click the _Submit Data_ button.

## If you have already uploaded the thumbnail images

* Make sure you are signed in as a FaceBase Writer (you have joined the FaceBase Writer group for your project).
* Search for your file (drilling down using the filter sidebar or adding keywords to the search bar).
* Click the View (“eye”) icon (in the _Action_ column) to view its metadata. (Warning: Do not click the Edit "pencil" icon - this is only editing the base record - not related records.)
* Scroll down to the "Thumbnails" section.
* Click the _Edit_ button on the right hand side of the table header to switch into a table view of the thumbnails.
* For each thumbnail you want to link to a file, click its _Edit_ "pencil" icon. The metadata form appears.
* Find the “Thumbnails of” field.
* Click the dropdown field and search for the corresponding source filename, then click the corresponding select box.
* Scroll down to the "Show in dataset" field and and make sure it reads _true_.
* When you are finished, scroll back to the top of the page and click the _Submit Data_ button.
