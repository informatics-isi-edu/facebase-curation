Once your request is processed and reviewed, you will be notified via email whether or not your request is approved.

Allow approximately 4-6 weeks for a response. If approved, you will have access to the human data for **one year after the approval date**.{: .bg-info}

If you receive an approval email, a member of the FaceBase Hub will contact you directly to provide the data securely (i.e., you will not download the data directly from the regular website.) The process will use encryption as described on the next page.

If you have any questions regarding this process or need help with downloads please contact the FaceBase Help Desk via email: **help AT facebase.org**.
