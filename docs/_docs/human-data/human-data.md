Controlled-access data is not available until you have submitted the required documents and are approved by the Data Access Committee (DAC) in the process described in this section.

## Controlled-access Data Policy

Controlled-access data is limited to the following types of data:

* **All individual-level human data**.
* Examples include demographic descriptors, phenotypic measures, 3D images, and sequencing data.

## Before You Begin...

In order to create and submit the Data Access Request (DAR), **you must join the FaceBase Users' group** (if you have submitted data for FaceBase, you should already be in this group).

* Click the "Sign Up" link at the top right corner of the FaceBase site - [or use this link](https://app.globus.org/groups/143f5bdc-c127-11e4-ab32-22000a1dd033/about) - and follow the prompts to log in with Globus and ask to Join the "FaceBase Users" group.

You will also need to gather the following information to complete this process:

* Research Use Statement â€“ A description of your proposed work and how FaceBase data will be used. **Note:** If your access request is approved, this will be a publicly viewable description.
* Non-Technical Summary - A brief lay summary of your proposed work. **Note:** If your access request is approved, this will be a publicly viewable description.
* Brief description of how your proposed research is consistent with the Data Use Limitations (DULs) for the requested data.
* Brief description of data security measures implemented to ensure protection of any downloaded data.
* List of collaborators (internal and external)
* If your desired dataset requires IRB approval, you will need an Institutional Review Board (IRB) letter and IRB-approved protocol describing how you will use the data for research purposes. If you have questions about the process or IRB requirement, please contact the DAC at <a href="mailto:nidcrfacebasedac@mail.nih.gov">nidcrfacebasedac@mail.nih.gov</a>. [Also see our FAQ about IRBs here](https://www.facebase.org/help/faqs/#irb).
