The FaceBase Data Browser is a model-driven web interface for data discovery, analysis, visualization, editing, sharing and collaboration over tabular data to allow users to:

* Search, explore, and browse collections of data
* Navigate from one data record to the next by following their relationships
* Explore and export data collections
* Share and cite data with other users or for use in publications

The Data Browser represents data via records that can be filtered with attributes in the sidebar much like you would in an online shopping site.

## Example of a Data Browser search page

Above is a typical example of a FaceBase Data Browser search page. Common elements are:

* Filtering sidebar
* Search bar above the results
* Search results based on filters.

## Beginning your search

You may begin your search with the [All datasets link](https://www.facebase.org/chaise/recordset/#1/isa:dataset@sort(release_date::desc::,RID)). You can also start with a narrowed search by species. These are available in the top navigation menu:

Your search will start with the resulting search page, where you may then further refine your search with the filtering sidebar and then you can drill down to a specific dataset on the detail page.

* [Search page](../search-page/) - This page shows the records available in the deployment and the records that match filters.
* [Detail page](../detail-page/) - This page shows the details for an individual record and its related tables.
