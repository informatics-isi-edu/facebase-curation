The FaceBase system includes pipelines that convert data into helpful visualizations that can deepen a user's experience with the data.


## Image Volume viewer

Example datasets:
- https://www.facebase.org/chaise/record/#1/isa:dataset/RID=TKT
- https://www.facebase.org/chaise/record/#1/isa:dataset/RID=1-SXC4


Using the TBD dataset as an example of how the original NIFTI files were converted into a viewer in the browser.

Scroll down to the section "Downsampled Image Previews"

Full resolution NIFT format microCT images. NIFTI is one medical imaging standard that's widely supported and can be viewable by most available tools.

Click here to load the image.

Orthogonal slice viewer displays different panes that 'slice' through different orientations of the 3D image.

Click the **Volumes** label in the top left and choose 3D. This converts the image to 3D Volume. Then use the Threshold bar to adjust as/if needed until the image is clear.

You can view this in action in [TBD video](#).

## Histology

Example dataset:
- https://www.facebase.org/chaise/record/#1/isa:imaging_data/RID=1-W96W  

histology viewer: image 1-W96W displays new feature: Annotations.

In this micropscopy image, there are annotations of interest. You can zoom in and pan around. Our viewer supports very high resolution imaging, so depending on the resolution, you can zoom in deeply almost like an online microscope.

Contributors can add annotations which are linked to our anatomy terms. For more information link TBD.

## Single Cell Viewer

Example datasets:
- https://www.facebase.org/chaise/record/#1/isa:dataset/RID=1-YSFP
- https://www.facebase.org/chaise/record/#1/isa:dataset/RID=R-PPWJ
