For more sophisticated users, who may need to perform complex data retrieval or searches for using FaceBase open-access data for analysis, pipelines, etc, there is a Python interface available called **deriva-py**.

However, you will need to understand about how the data is modeled in the underlying [DERIVA system](https://docs.derivacloud.org). Please reach out to the FaceBase Hub at help@facebase.org, let us know what you need and we can provide guidance to get you started.

You can find more general information about the python interface at the following links: [DataPath documentation](https://docs.derivacloud.org/deriva-py/README.html), [GitHub repo for deriva-py](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/deriva-py). Note that there is also an R wrapper available for this code.
