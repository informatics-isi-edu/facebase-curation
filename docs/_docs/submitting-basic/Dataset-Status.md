title: Releasing Your Dataset
permalink: /docs/Dataset-Status/

New datasets are initially visible only to the project to which they are
attributed. This includes all of the dataset metadata and data files that are
linked to the dataset. In order for a dataset to be "released" on the FaceBase
site, a member of the FaceBase Hub must review the dataset and update its
'Released' field to 'true'. Once released, the dataset will be visible to
other users of the FaceBase site.

## How to get your dataset released

First, review your dataset and all of its associated metadata (i.e.,
experiments, biosample details, replicates) and data files. You may need to
review with other members of your project or the PI(s). Once you and your
colleagues decide the dataset is ready to be released, send an email to the Hub
at [help@facebase.org](mailto:help@facebase.org). A Hub curator will review your dataset and notify you
either that the dataset has been released or that the dataset needs some
additional data entry/edit by you.
